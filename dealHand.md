// Implement the dealHand function.
// It takes a deck, which is an array of strings representing each card,
// and it takes an integer that indicates the number of cards expected in the result.


// Expectations:
// 1. The number of cards must match the expected hand size.
// 2. The cards dealt must come from the deck.
// 3. A card may not be used more than once.
